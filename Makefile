# Which exploit core the target's kernel needs. The attack chain is fixed to a
# GKI branch rather than to a SoC, so a target on a different kernel series
# needs a different core, not a different set of offsets:
#
#   core66   android15-6.6, from pmg110-root
#   core612  android16-6.12, from warhol-root (upstream popsicle plus its MTE fix)
#   core510  5.10 (Meta's own kernel, not a GKI branch), from IonStackQuest3
#
# It is declared per target in src/targets.json and CI passes it down, so the
# default here only matters for a hand-typed build.

# Every core is an imported tree kept as close to the port it came from as it

# pmg110-root and core510 three against IonStackQuest3, all listed in the
# README. What under $(CORE_DIR) is *not* imported is root.c -- and, for
# core510 alone, the exp32_blob.S that carries its 32-bit stage inside the
# payload. Both are this repository's own, and are named so that a core's code
# stays in that core's directory:
#
#   <core>/root.c  how that core gets the bootstrap helper resident as root.
#                  core66 and core61 queue a usermodehelper work item from an
#                  unprivileged process (install_android_root); core612 is
#                  already root and execs it (install_embedded_su -> the shared
#                  root_helper.c); core510 roots a forked child that has had
#                  its seccomp filter cleared as well, and that child execs it
#                  from an install_embedded_su of its own. One is linked per
#                  build, and it is listed apart from CORE_SRCS below so the
#                  build still says which side of the import each file is on.
#
# No port has a file by that name -- their own app glue is preload.c,
# su_daemon.c and an .incbin blob, none of which was copied -- so re-importing
# a core is still "replace everything here but root.c".
#
# What is this repository's own and shared by every core:
#
#   mte.c          whether this boot's kernel tags heap pointers. Core-neutral
#                  and linked into every build; core612 is the one that reads
#                  it, because warhol's answer follows the flashed preloader
#                  rather than the firmware its target header came from.
#   preload.c      the retry supervisor, shared by all.
#   root_helper.c  getting the helper resident from a context that is already
#                  root, init hijack included. Linked only into the cores whose
#                  glue calls it -- see ROOT_HELPER_CORES below.

# armeabi-v7a, and a dynamically linked PIE. It has to stay 32-bit: the stack
# geometry the stamp is written at is the compat one, and a 64-bit build of the

# flags rather than COMMON_CFLAGS -- it shares no header with the payload but
# the kernelsnitch helpers, and it never sees the target header.
#
# DELTA against IonStackQuest3, which builds this -static: an
# application-launched run may not execve() a file it wrote itself, and its one
# remaining way to start this stage is to hand it to bionic's linker as a
# loader -- which can only load a dynamic PIE (core510/root.c has the policy
# read). Dropping -static is what makes that route exist, and it takes the
# stage from about 1.6MB to tens of kilobytes, which is also what lets the
# payload carry a copy at all. A shell run execs it directly either way. The
# static build is still one flag away (EXP32_CFLAGS=-static) for comparing
# against the run that first reached root on quest3, which was a static one.
#
# EXP32_CFLAGS is a lever of its own rather than a share of EXTRA_CFLAGS,
# because the one flag anybody needs here must NOT reach the 64-bit payload.
# The run that reached root on quest3 was a -DDEBUG build of THIS stage only
# (verified by hash: the stage's pr_debug sites are what put "consumer:
# calling sched_setattr" in that run's log) against a payload built without
# it. -DDEBUG turns on six one-shot pr_debug lines in the 32-bit stage, one
# of which sits immediately before the syscall that triggers the prio-chain
# walk -- with IONSTACK_LOG pointing at an O_SYNC file, that line is a
# synchronous write inside the race window, so it is not obviously
# decoration. Reproduce that build with EXP32_CFLAGS=-DDEBUG.
